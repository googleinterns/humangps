The project is to find dense human correspondence across 2D images. which is rather useful for various human-specific applications including non-rigid tracking and reconstruction, neural rendering and appearance transfer. The idea is to utilize  geodesic distance as an effective supervision, together with novel loss functions to learn a deep feature, which can then be used to find pixel correspondences between images of same/different subjects.
